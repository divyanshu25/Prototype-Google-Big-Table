# Prototype-Google-Big-Table
We   aim  to  design  a  prototype  database  similar  to  Google’s  Big  Table  which  is  distributed, 
scalable  and  fault  tolerant. Our design  is based  on the Google’s BigTable paper.Google’s Big 
Table   is  distributed,  scalable  and  highly  fault  tolerant  system  which  uses  GFS(Google  File 
System)  for  file  management  and  Zookeeper  for  node  management. We  have also borrowed 
some ideas from Cassandra and consistent Hashing.
